# Project Report: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Using WhatsApp Chat Data

## Overview
This project focuses on extracting insights from textual data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
<br>
The primary objective is to analyze communication patterns, user engagement, and content dynamics within WhatsApp group chats. <br>
By leveraging NLP methodologies and advanced algorithms, we aim to provide valuable insights and enhance understanding and decision-making based on WhatsApp conversations.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The project involves collecting WhatsApp chat data and performing necessary preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes:
- Normalizing text (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing punctuation)
- diving text into different features for easy access of different elements
- using regular expression to build a equation to do the step mentioned above

## Visualizations and Sentiment Analysis
The project offers visualizations and sentiment analysis to provide deeper insights:
- Sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of conversations
- Visualizations to represent sentiment trends and keyword distributions

## Applications and Implications
NLP techniques have transformative potential in various domains such as:
- Social media analytics
- Customer support optimization
- Education
- Political campaigning
- Healthcare communication

The results of keyword extraction provide valuable insights for group administrators and participants to tailor communication strategies, address concerns, and enhance the group dynamic.



Ultimately, this project signifies the potential of NLP in improving communication strategies and enhancing community engagement within digital platforms like WhatsApp.
